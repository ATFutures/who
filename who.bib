  abstract = {OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced geographic database, provides the only global-level, openly licensed source of geospatial road data, and the only national-level source in many countries. However, researchers, policy makers, and citizens who want to make use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) have little information about whether it can be relied upon in a particular geographic setting. In this paper, we use two complementary, independent methods to assess the completeness of OSM road data in each country in the world. First, we undertake a visual assessment of OSM data against satellite imagery, which provides the input for estimates based on a multilevel regression and poststratification model. Second, we fit sigmoid curves to the cumulative length of contributions, and use them to estimate the saturation level for each country. Both techniques may have more general use for assessing the development and saturation of crowd-sourced data. Our results show that in many places, researchers and policymakers can rely on the completeness of OSM, or will soon be able to do so. We find (i) that globally, OSM is ∼83\% complete, and more than 40\% of countries—including several in the developing world—have a fully mapped street network; (ii) that well-governed countries with good Internet access tend to be more complete, and that completeness has a U-shaped relationship with population density—both sparsely populated areas and dense cities are the best mapped; and (iii) that existing global datasets used by the World Bank undercount roads by more than 30\%.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of motor vehicles, practicing engineers and city planner have underestimated the potential of non-motorized transport. As traffic congestion has become severe in many large cities, especially in the developing world, other transport alternatives need to be considered and efficient public transport systems should be given utter priority as they have enormous environmental, social and commercial benefits. There are several options of public transport system. However, in recent times the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system option is fast catching up with developing countries. Accra has in recent years been grappling to put in place a public transport system. The BRT concept has been introduced and the World Bank has pledged to support it having ascertained its feasibility [1,2]. Inevitably, there has arisen the need to integrate cycling into the BRT system owing to the increasing use of bicycles in Accra. The integration will afford commuters the opportunity to combined different modes in the most efficient, time and cost-effective manner. This would therefore require strategic planning to link cycle routes to terminals on major route.},
